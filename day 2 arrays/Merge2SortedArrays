let,
a = [1,3,5,7]   b = [0,2,6,8,9]

Approach 1 :
take 2 pointers, 
one at a's last, another at b's first
    if a[i] > b[j]
        Swap & move both pointers
    do until a[i] > b[j] then break;

    Finally, Sort both the arrays
    Tc : O(nlogn * 2) + O(n+m)

Approach 2 :
Gap Method
Tc : O(log(n+m)) + O(n+m)
